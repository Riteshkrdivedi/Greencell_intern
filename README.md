# Voltage Data Analysis

This project analyzes voltage time-series data using Python.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Time-series visualization
- 5-point moving average calculation
- Detection of peaks and lows
- Detection of low-voltage events
- Downward acceleration analysis

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the CSV file
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Output
- Line graph of voltage vs time
- Moving average trend
- CSV files for peaks, lows, and critical values
